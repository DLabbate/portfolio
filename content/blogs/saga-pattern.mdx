## Prerequisites

To understand this topic fully, familiarity with **transactions** and **microservices** is recommended.

Here are some of my previous blog posts that will be useful:

- [Maintain Database Consistency With Transactions](/blogs/db-transactions)
- [Microservice Orchestration vs. Choreography](/blogs/orchestration-vs-choreography)

## Introduction

In **distributed systems**, workflows often span multiple **microservices**.

Let’s consider the example of a travel application that I have used in my previous blog posts.
This application is responsible for coordinating between an airline service, a hotel service, and a car rental service.
This allows users to book all essential services for their vacation in one place.

## Example Workflow

1. Reserve airline tickets
2. Reserve a hotel
3. Reserve a rental car

In a **monolithic** application, with all data in a single database, achieving a transaction is straightforward because everything is handled within the same database context.

However, in a **distributed system**, each service (airline, hotel, car rental) operates independently, with its own database.
_Ensuring that all services either succeed or fail as a unit becomes much more challenging!_

## Problem

To illustrate this concern, imagine the following scenario:

1. ✔️ Airline reservation is successful.

2. ✔️ Hotel reservation is successful.

3. ❌ Rental car reservation fails.

Now, the user is left with partial reservations, an inconsistent state where only some services are booked, leading to a poor user experience.

<Alert
  type="error"
  title="Partial Success"
  text="The user paid for airline tickets, hotel reservation, and a rental car, but
  is left in a state of partial success where only some services are booked!"
/>

## Solution: The Saga Pattern

The **Saga pattern** helps by treating the entire workflow as a series of steps, each with an associated **compensating action** (a rollback step to undo previous work if something goes wrong).

<Alert
  type="info"
  title="Compensating Action"
  text="In a Saga workflow, each step is associated with a compensating action (a rollback step to undo previous work if something goes wrong)."
/>

Recall the example:

1. ✔️ Airline reservation is successful.

2. ✔️ Hotel reservation is successful.

3. ❌ Rental car reservation fails.

Using the Saga Pattern, we can roll back previous steps:

↩️ **Cancel hotel reservation**

↩️ **Cancel airline reservation**

/>

As illustred in the image above, the operation behaves atomically:
either all services are booked, or none are, ensuring users will not be left with partial bookings.

## Conclusion

- The **Saga pattern** is an approach to achieve **transactions** in a **distributed system**.
- This is achieved by each step in a workflow having an associated **compensating action**,
  i.e. rollback to undo previous work if a failure is encountered.
- This improves the **reliability** and **data consistency** of a system.
