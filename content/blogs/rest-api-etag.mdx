## Introduction

Prior to reading this article, I would recommend first reading my blog: [Optimistic Concurrency in Databases](/blogs/db-optimistic-concurrency).

The `ETag` (or **entity tag**) HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource.
In this article, we will discuss how this header is useful to prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other.

## Problem

Let's first illustrate the problem by considering a REST API that _does not_ leverage `ETag` headers.

Consider a blog website, where multiple users can make edits to the same blog post. Here is a simplified representation of the REST API:

```
GET /blogs/{blogId}
PUT /blogs/{blogId}
```

Now imagine that two users (User A and User B) both make edits at the same time:

  alt="REST API Without ETag Headers"

  width={1240}
  height={632}
/>

As illustrated in the diagram above, without `ETag` it is possible to overwrite changes made by another user!

<Alert
  type="warning"
  text="REST APIs without ETag headers are at risk of overwriting changes made by other users."
/>

## Solution

This problem can be resolved by leveraging `ETag` and `If-Match` headers.

### What is the ETag Header?

An `ETag` is a version identifier for a resource, ensuring **updates are made only when the current version is matched**.

<Alert
  type="info"
  title="(Definition) ETag Header"
  text="The ETag (or entity tag) HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource."
/>

This is returned as a header in the `GET` endpoint of a resource.

### What is the If-Match Header?

The `If-Match` header is used in HTTP requests to ensure that a resource is updated only if it matches a specific version.
In more detail, it contains the `ETag` which can be retrieved by the `GET` endpoint of a resource.

<Alert
  type="info"
  title="(Definition) If-Match header"
  text="The If-Match header is used in HTTP requests to ensure that a resource is updated only if it matches a specific version."
/>

### ETag formats (Weak, Strong)

#### Weak

Weak `ETag` values of two representations of the same resources might be semantically equivalent, but not byte-for-byte identical.

```
ETag: W/"0815"
```

#### Strong

Strong `ETag` values **uniquely represent the requested resource**. It is a string of ASCII characters placed between double quotes, like `"675af34563dc-tr34"`.
The ETag can be generated as a hash of the content, a hash of the last modification timestamp, or just a version number.

```
ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
```

### ETag in Concurrency Control

The image below illustrates a modified example where `ETag` and `If-Match` headers are used to prevent simultaneous updates from overwriting each other.

<ThemeImage
  srcLight="/blogs/rest-api-etag/with-etag-light.png"
  srcDark="/blogs/rest-api-etag/with-etag-dark.png"
  alt="UML sequence diagram of a REST API that leverages ETag and If-Match headers"
  caption="REST API with ETag and If-Match Headers"
  width={1282}
  height={692}
/>

When performing the update via the `PUT /blogs/{blogId}`, an `If-Match` header is passed (with the `ETag` value).
If the version of the resource does not match, a `412 (Precondition Failed)` response will be returned.

As a result, User B will not overwrite the changes made by User A!

<Alert
  type="correct"
  text="As a result, User B will not overwrite the changes made by User A!"
/>

<Alert
  type="info"
  title="412 (Precondition Failed)"
  text="412 (Precondition Failed) response is returned by the server if the provided ETag value does not match that of the resource."
/>

### What Happens Without If-Match Header

<ThemeImage
  srcLight="/blogs/rest-api-etag/missing-if-match-header-light.png"
  srcDark="/blogs/rest-api-etag/missing-if-match-header-dark.png"
  alt="UML sequence diagram of a REST API that leverages ETag and If-Match headers"
  caption="REST API With ETag Headers"
  width={902}
  height={682}
/>

In the case that no `If-Match` header is provided to the `PUT /blogs/{blogId}`, the server can respond with `428 (Precondition Required)` response.

<Alert
  type="info"
  title="428 (Precondition Required)"
  text="428 (Precondition Required) response is returned by the server if no If-Match header is provided in the PUT operation."
/>

## Conclusion

- The `ETag` (or **entity tag**) HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource.
- It is useful to prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other by returning a `412 (Precondition Failed)` response when the `If-Match` header does not match the expected value.
