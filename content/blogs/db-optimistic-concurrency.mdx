## Introduction

In modern applications, concurrency is common, as multiple users often interact with the same data.
One significant challenge that arises is race conditions, where two or more clients attempt to update the same resource simultaneously. This can lead to data inconsistency.

To handle this, we can use **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**, which ensures that conflicting updates are detected before changes are committed.

In this article, we'll explore how OCC works and how it prevents issues such as booking the same airplane ticket for two different passengers.

## Problem

Let's consider a real-world example of an airline ticket reservation system. Here's a simplified model of an **Airplane Ticket**:

```sql
-- Simplified representation of an airline ticket reservation system in SQL
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for the ticket
    reserved BOOLEAN NOT NULL,    -- Indicates whether the ticket is reserved or not
);
```

Imagine two users, Angelo and Bruno, both trying to book the same ticket.

```sql
-- Example SQL query
SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE reserved = false;
```

1. Angelo views that a ticket (`id = abc123`) is available (`reserved = false`).
2. Bruno views the same ticket (`id = abc123`) as available.
3. Both attempt to reserve the ticket simultaneously.

```sql
UPDATE tickets
SET reserved = true
WHERE Id = @ticketId
```

4. Both receive a successful reservation notification.

<Alert
  type="error"
  title="Race Condition"
  text="However, only one of them should have been able to reserve the ticket, as there is only one available. 
  This is a classic race conditionâ€”both users are led to believe they successfully booked the same seat, but in reality, only one should have succeeded."
/>

## Solution

To handle this issue, we can use **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**. The key idea is that when a record is retrieved, the system also tracks its `version` (or `timestamp`).
Before updating the record, the version is checked to ensure it hasn't changed since the data was retrieved.

<Alert
  type="correct"
  title="Solution"
  text="Before updating the record, the version is checked to ensure it hasn't changed since the data was retrieved."
/>

Hereâ€™s how we can modify the process: add a `version` field to the airplane ticket record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    reserved BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    version INT NOT NULL -- Version column for optimistic concurrency control
);
```

When Angelo and Bruno view the available ticket, they retrieve the ticket along with its current version (e.g., `version = 1`).

```sql
-- Example SQL query with version tracking
SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE reserved = false AND version = 1;
```

Here is what the update will now look like:

```sql
UPDATE tickets
SET reserved = true, version = version + 1
WHERE Id = @ticketId AND version = 1;
```

Notice that when an attempt is made to reserve the ticket, the version is included in the query. Moreover, after a successful update, the version is incremented.

<Alert
  type="info"
  text="The version is included in the query. Moreover, after a successful update, the version is incremented."
/>

Thus, even if both Angelo and Bruno attempt to reserve the ticket at the same time, only one of them will be successful!

Suppose that Angelo successfully reserved the ticket first.
Now, when Bruno tries to update the same ticket, the system checks the version number. Since it has already changed due to Angeloâ€™s update, Brunoâ€™s update fails.

```sql
-- Bruno's update attempt will fail because the version has changed
UPDATE tickets
SET reserved = true, version = version + 1
WHERE id = @ticketId AND version = 1; -- This will now throw an error
```

The second update attempt will trigger a concurrency conflict error, and Bruno will be notified that the ticket is no longer available.

## Alternatives

One alternative to **Optimistic Concurrency Control** is **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**, where records are ðŸ”’ locked when a transaction begins, preventing others from accessing or modifying the data until the lock is released.
While this method is effective, it can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in high-traffic systems.

In my experience, I have rarely encountered the need for pessimistic locking, which is why I chose to focus on optimistic concurrency in this article.

## Conclusion

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control** is an effective way to handle race conditions in database systems where multiple users are interacting with the same data.
- By ensuring that updates only occur if the data hasn't changed since it was read, we can avoid conflicts and maintain data integrity.
