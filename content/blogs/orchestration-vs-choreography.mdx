## Introduction

In the context of a distributed system, it is very common for a business workflow to span multiple microservices.
For instance, a travel booking service might need to coordinate work across a airline service, hotel service, and car rental service.

There are two common methods to architect such a workflow: **Orchestration** and **Choreography**. In this article we will discuss both approaches, and the tradeoffs associated with each one.

## Orchestration

### Overview

As the name implies, **Orchestration** involves the a central orchestrator that is responsible for coordination work across all the microservices.

### Pros

- ✔️ Business logic is centralized
- ✔️ Easy to troubleshoot/debug

### Cons

- ❌ The **Orchestrator** is a single point of failure.

### Choreography

### Overview

In a **Choreography** based approach, rather than having a central point of command, microservices communicate with one another, typically via events.

See my article on [asynchronous messaging](/blogs/async-messaging) for more details.

### Pros

- ✔️ No single point of failure
- ✔️ Loose coupling

### Cons

- ❌ Business logic is scattered across various services.
- ❌ Debugging/troubleshooting is more difficult because it must be performed across multiple services.

## Conclusion

- Orchestration involves a central orchestrator. It is good for clear control flow but has a single point of failure.
- Choreography is decentralized, but can be challenging to debug.
