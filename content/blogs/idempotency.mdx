## Introduction

In the context of software engineering, `idempotency` is an important concept which plays a crucial role in improving the fault tolerance and reliability of an application.

To better understand this concept and its significance, let's start off by illustrating an example.

## Example: Why Idempotency Matters

In the following example, we will discuss the impact of _not_ considering idempotency.

### Scenario

Let's imagine that we have a client (user) and a server. The user would like to purchase a product from the website.

1. The user clicks on the "buy" button in the UI.
2. The server processes the payment request.
3. Unfortunately there is a network failure, and the user does not know if the first request was successfully processed.
4. The user becomes frustrated, and clicks the "buy" button a second time.

**ðŸ˜¡ However, later in the day the user notices that they were charged twice on their credit card bill!**

  width={1213}
  height={734}
/>

### What Went Wrong?

Why did this occur? From the server's perspective, it received two separate requests and processed both of them successfully!
The server had no way of knowing that both requests should _not_ have been handled separately..

### The Idempotent Solution

The solution to this problem is `idempotency`.

Idempotency can be summarized as the ability to safely retry an operation without unintended side effects.

## How to Implement Idempotency

Now that we understand the definition of idempotency, let's discuss how we can actually implement it.
One approach is to rely on **unique identifiers**. This way, even if a request is sent multiple times, the system can recognize duplicates and handle them accordingly.

In our example, we can refactor the server to accept a `transactionId` field. If an operation is retried with the same `transactionId`, the server should only process it once.

That is actually how industry leaders such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests) and [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/idempotency)
implement idempotency!

## Key Benefits

Let's review some key aspects that our system will benefit from.

- **Enhanced Reliability:** Idempotency ensures that your operations remain reliable even in the face of network failures or multiple requests.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users can interact with applications confidently, knowing that glitches wonâ€™t result in accidental multiple charges or unintended actions.

## Idempotency is Ubiquitous

Another important detail to mention is that idempotency does _not_ only apply to API endpoints.
For example, idempotency is an important point to consider even when designing functions, message consumers, database operations, etc.

**Idempotency is language-agnostic and ubiquitous.**

## Conclusion

- We can improve the fault tolerance and reliablity of an application by considering idempotency
- Idempotency can be implemeneted by leveraging unique identifiers
