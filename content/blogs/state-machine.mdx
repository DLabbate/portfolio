## Introduction

The **state machine** design pattern is a useful approach when dealing with a system that can be in one of several states, with logic for transitioning between them.

In order to illustrate the benefits of this approach, let's first begin with an example, _without_ using the pattern.

## Problem

Suppose we want to implement a _Super Mario_ video game.
The main character Mario can be in one of the following states:

```cs
public enum MarioState
{
    Dead,
    Small,
    Super,
    Invincible
}
```

Mario can also encounter various items and enemies, which will affect the state as depicted by the following diagram:

  alt="State machine diagram for Super Mario video game."

  width={1243 / 2}
  height={1393 / 2}
/>

We might write some code like the following:

```cs
public class Mario
{
    private MarioState currentState;

    // ...

    public void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        switch (currentState)
        {
            case MarioState.Small:
                Console.WriteLine("Small Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Powering up to Super Mario.");
                currentState = MarioState.Super;
                break;
            case MarioState.Super:
                Console.WriteLine("Super Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Nothing happens as Super Mario.");
                break;
            case MarioState.Invincible:
                Console.WriteLine("Invincible Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Nothing happens as Invincible Mario.");
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

We can achieve this with conditional logic via switch statements.

However, if project requirements change (e.g. a new state is added), all the switch statements will need to be modified!

<Alert
  type="warning"
  text="If we continued with this approach, our code would quickly become cluttered with switch statements that are difficult to maintain!"
/>

## Solution

Let's see how we can refactor this using the **state machine** design pattern to make our code cleaner and more maintainable.

<ThemeImage

  alt="Class diagram for state machine design pattern."

  width={1144}
  height={544}
/>
The key takeaway from this class diagram is that we encapsulate each state into its
own class, all inheriting from the base `State` class.

<Alert
  type="info"
  text="States are extracted into their own class, implementing the same interface."
/>

_Some additional notes are listed below._

- The `Context` class stores a reference to one of the concrete `State` objects in order to delegate all state-specific work.
- The `Context` also exposes a setter for passing it a new state object (i.e. when we need to perform a state transition) via the `TransitionTo` method.

## Refactored Example

Let's refactor our example to see what this would look like.

  alt="Refactored example using the state machine design pattern."

/>

```cs
using System;

// This class represents the "Context" class, which stores a reference to one of the concrete State objects.
public class Mario
{
    private MarioState state;

    public Mario()
    {
        state = new SmallMarioState(this);
    }

    // The Context exposes a method to update the State at runtime.
    public void TransitionTo(MarioState newState)
    {
        state = newState;
    }

    // The Context delegates logic to the State object.
    public void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        state.ObtainMushroom();
    }

    public void ObtainStar()
    {
        state.ObtainStar();
    }

    public void CollideEnemy()
    {
        state.CollideEnemy();
    }
}
```

```cs
// The base State class declares methods that all concrete State should implement.
public abstract class MarioState
{
    // The State class also provides a backreference to the "context" object,
    // associated with the State. This backreference can be used by States to
    // transition the Context to another State.
    protected Mario mario;

    public MarioState(Mario mario)
    {
        this.mario = mario;
    }

    public void ObtainMushroom() { }
    public void ObtainStar() { }
    public void CollideEnemy() { }
}
```

A little detail you might notice in the base state class is that there
is a backreference to the `Mario` class, i.e. the `Context` class.

This backreference is necessary to transition the `Context` to another `State`.

```cs
public class SmallMarioState : MarioState
{
    public SmallMarioState(Mario mario) : base(mario) { }

    public override void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Small Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Powering up to Super Mario.");
        mario.TransitionTo(new SuperMarioState(mario));
    }

    public override void ObtainStar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Small Mario obtained a ‚≠ê star! Powering up to Invincible Mario.");
        mario.TransitionTo(new InvincibleMarioState(mario));
    }

    public override void CollideEnemy()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Small Mario collided with an enemy! Mario is dead ‚ò†Ô∏è.");
        mario.TransitionTo(new DeadMarioState(mario));
    }
}
```

```cs
public class SuperMarioState : MarioState
{
    public SuperMarioState(Mario mario) : base(mario) { }

    public override void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Super Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Nothing happens as Super Mario.");
    }

    public override void ObtainStar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Super Mario obtained a ‚≠ê star! Powering up to Invincible Mario.");
        mario.TransitionTo(new InvincibleMarioState(mario));
    }

    public override void CollideEnemy()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Mario collided with an enemy! Powering down to Small Mario.");
        mario.TransitionTo(new SmallMarioState(mario));
    }
}
```

```cs
public class InvincibleMarioState : MarioState
{
    public InvincibleMarioState(Mario mario) : base(mario) { }

    public override void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invincible Mario obtained a üçÑ mushroom! Nothing happens.");
    }

    public override void ObtainStar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invincible Mario obtained a ‚≠ê star! Nothing happens.");
    }

    public override void CollideEnemy()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invincible Mario collided with an enemy! Enemy defeated.");
    }
}
```

```cs
// There can be additional logic for determining game over, etc.
// This was omitted for simplicity.
public class DeadMarioState : MarioState
{
    public override void ObtainMushroom()
    {
        // Dead, so do nothing.
    }

    public override void ObtainStar()
    {
        // Dead, so do nothing.
    }

    public override void CollideEnemy()
    {
        // Dead, so do nothing.
    }
}
```

And finally, the client can instantiate the `Mario` class and call the methods as required:

```cs
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Mario mario = new Mario();

        mario.ObtainMushroom();
        mario.ObtainStar();
        mario.CollideEnemy();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

‚úîÔ∏è Code is organized into distinct state classes instead of conditionals, improving readability and maintainability.

‚úîÔ∏è The pattern allows for extensibility (e.g. if we need to add a new state or make modifications to an existing state without impacting other states).
