## Introduction

For many types of applications, maintaining data consistency is critical. In the following article we will discuss how a database transaction can help us meet this need.

Let's begin with an example, _without_ using database transactions.

## Example

Imagine a bank transfer between recipients Bruno and Emily. Bruno would like to transfer an amount of $100 to Emily.

Below is a table outlining the account details _before_ the transfer takes place.

| Name  | Account Total |
| ----- | ------------- |
| Bruno | $1000         |
| Emily | $1000         |

The application logic might be similar to the following:

1. Add $100 to Emily's bank account.
2. Deduct $100 from Bruno's bank account.

Now imagine that the database is experiencing some downtime, and the following occurs:

✔️ Step 1 passes

❌ Step 2 fails

This is what the account details would look like:

| Name  | Account Total |
| ----- | ------------- |
| Bruno | $1000         |
| Emily | $1100         |

**We are now in an inconsistent state! Emily has just received a free $100.**

## Database Transactions

  text="A database transaction is an all-or-nothing operation. Either all the steps complete successfully, or none of them."
/>

Let's revise the example with a transaction.

✔️ Step 1 succeeds

❌ Step 2 fails

If a transaction does not complete normally, the system rolls back the changes. In other words, the original state (prior to executing the transaction) is restored.

Hence, both Bruno and Emily's account will be the same as before the transaction started.

| Name  | Account Total |
| ----- | ------------- |
| Bruno | $1000         |
| Emily | $1000         |

Although the transaction failed, we have at least maintained the consistency of our data.

## Properties of Database Transactions

Database transactions are characterized by ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).

### Atomicity

A transaction can involve several database operations. The **atomic** property of transactions guarantees that all of the operations complete successfully, or none at all.
In other words, a transaction will never be _partially_ executed.

### Consistency

A transaction guarantees that our database will always move from one **consistent** state to another.
In our previous example of transferring funds, the sum of both accounts will be the same before and after the transaction.

### Isolation

The **isolation** property enforces that intermediate states of a transaction are not visible to other transactions. This allows transactions to run concurrently.

### Durability

The **durability** property guarantees that when a transaction completes successfully, the data changes are persisted and will not be reversed (even in the event of a system failure).

## Database Providers

Many databases provide this feature. Some examples are listed below:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/transactions)
- ...

## Conclusion

If you need to perform multiple database operations atomically, you should consider transactions in order to maintain data consistency.
