## Prerequisites

To understand this topic fully, familiarity with **transactions**, **microservices**, **event-driven architecture**,
and **idempotency** is recommended.

Here are some of my previous blog posts that will be useful:

- [Maintain Database Consistency With Transactions](/blogs/db-transactions)
- [Microservice Orchestration vs. Choreography](/blogs/orchestration-vs-choreography)
- [Scalability With Asynchronous Messaging](/blogs/async-messaging)
- [Idempotency is Important](/blogs/idempotency)

## Introduction

With a **microservice** architecture, it is very common to do something like the following:

1. Create/update/delete an entity.
2. Publish an event to a message broker.

For instance, consider an e-commerce system. Every time we create an `Order` via the `OrderService`,
we also publish an `OrderCreatedEvent` so that related services can react accordingly.

Some examples of services that must perform an action when an `OrderCreatedEvent` is received:

- `InventoryService` needs to update its inventory data.
- `EmailService` sends a confirmation email to the customer.

It's likely we have some code like the following:

```cs
/**
 * Some pseudocode to illustrate creating a new order via the OrderService.
 */

// Step 1
Database.CreateOrder(orderInfo);

// Step 2
MessageBroker.Publish(new OrderCreatedEvent(orderInfo));
```

## Problem

However, like we have discussed in my previous blog posts, _things can fail!_ Suppose the following occurs:

1. ✔️ `Order` is created successfully.

2. ❌ Failure to send the `OrderCreatedEvent`.

```cs
// ✔️ Step 1
Database.CreateOrder(orderInfo);

// ❌ Step 2
MessageBroker.Publish(new OrderCreatedEvent(orderInfo));
```

  caption="Example Without Outbox Pattern"
  width={1044}
  height={486}
/>

Although it might appear as though the `Order` was created, the `OrderCreatedEvent` has actually been lost.
As a result, the `InventoryService` would not update its inventory data,
and the `EmailService` would not send the confirmation email to the user.

_For mission-critical workflows, this can have serious implications!_

## Solution: The Outbox Pattern

The **Outbox pattern** addresses this problem, via two main components:

1. Persisting events with **transactions**.
2. **Background worker** to publish events.

  and having a background worker publish these events."

The overall process is outlined by the sequence diagram below:

/>

Let's explore these concepts a bit further.

### Persisting Events With Transactions

First and foremost, events are persisted in the database, leveraging a **transaction**.

```cs
/**
 * Modified pseudocode leveraging the Outbox pattern.
 */

Database.StartTransaction();
  Database.CreateOrder(orderInfo);
  Database.PersistEvent(new OrderCreatedEvent(orderInfo));
Database.EndTransaction()
```

As illustrated by the pseudocode above, the two operations now execute atomically to ensure data consistency.

### Background Worker to Publish Events

The **background worker** queries the persisted events, publishes the events to the message broker, and finally marks them as processed.

This can be accomplished via **polling**.

## Considerations

Below are a few considerations that are important to keep in mind when implementing the **Outbox pattern**.

- **Order of publishing:** Events must be sent in the same order in which the service updates the database.
  For example, `OrderUpdated` should not be published before an `OrderCreated` event.
- **Idempotent consumers:** It is good practice to ensure that consumers are idempotent.
  In the case that duplicate messages are published, there would be no impact.

## Conclusion

- Events are persisted in the database alongside the create/update/delete of an entity, leveraging a **transaction**.
- A **background worker** is responsible for **polling** the events persisted in the database,
  publishing to a message broker, and finally marking the events as processed.
- The **Outbox pattern** improves the **reliability** of a system given that events will not be lost.
