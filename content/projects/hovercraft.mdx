In this competition, each team was tasked with building a fully autonomous hovercraft capable of navigating a specified track and surpassing obstacles of height 1mm to 3mm.
Using data from `infrared` & `ultrasonic` sensors, we devised a `position tracking algorithm` that completed the course in ‚è±Ô∏è 20 seconds!
